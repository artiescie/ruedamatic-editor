# ruedamatic-editor

**Electron program**, calls out rueda moves for dancing "rueda de casino".  Edits the data files for that purpose.  Produces simultaneously data files compatible with companion web application "rm-spot", which makes the rueda calls with Spotify.com music using the official Spotify web API.

[Download EXE](https://come2think.com/RuedaMatic/) from come2think.com.

### Build Setup

IMPORTANT: For npm install, the **--force** flag is now necessary, as npm dependency management rots from the age and number of dependencies.  A rewrite for newer electron and other basic parts would be good... if anyone wants to do that ;-).

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install --force

# serve with hot reload at localhost:9080
npm run dev

# build electron application for production
npm run build
```

### Some specific dependencies
#### In folder static:
 - ffmpegLocal.exe,
 - recycle-bin.exe.
 See the file "static/what's here.txt"

#### Root folder, build:
 - npm build includes <strong><em>fixdate.sh</strong></em>, which updates the build date in SystemInformation.vue
    - depends on (gnu) bash, plust the package "replace-in-file" from npm, installed globally
