ffmpegLocal.exe - renamed from standard ffmpeg.exe, old version 4.1 2018 but known to work as WE need
 - USE:
 - calculate md5 of a song file, excluding metadata tags like title, artist, lyrics, etc.  Constant even if metadata changes.
 - when you load a song, and create beats and a call sequence, they will contain the filename and md5 signature of the song.
 - then when you later load a Music file, RM looks for beats and call sequence files with the same file name.
 - then it compares the embedded md5 signatures with the music file, recalculating it as the song is loaded.
 - if the md5 doesn't agree, normally we won't load the beats and call sequence.
 - but you can over-ride this in a prompt
 - RATIONALE:
 - of course, it will be impossible to use a beats file prepared for a different music recording of the same song: the timing is off.
 - and even if the music file is the same recording, but remastered, likely there will be a different lead-in pause, putting off the timing.
 - timba music is not just a metronome, it has a lot of expression... intending for the dancers to respond appropriately.
 - So the call sequence SHOULD also be matched to the song it was made for.
